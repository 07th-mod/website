<p>Also, if you are aware of any other trusted mirrors of Umineko Project (which provide archives with identical checksums), please let us know, and we can put them on this page.</p>

<p>There do exist some other mirrors of Umineko Project but we don't want to link them in case they contain malware etc.</p>

<h2> Support </h2>

<p>For support on Umineko Project, please read the <a href="https://umineko-project.org/">Umineko Project website</a> and also try the <a href="https://forum.umineko-project.org/">Umineko Project Forums</a>.</p>

<p>While we also allow Umineko Project questions on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/pf5VhF9">07th-mod Discord</a>, replies will generally come from the community as most of the 07th-mod team has not worked on Umineko Project.</p>

<h2> FAQ </h2>

<h3> Why can't I download anymore from the MEGA mirror on the Umineko Project Website? </h3>

For free users, MEGA limits the amount you can download in 6 hours. Please retry the download in once more than 6 hours have passed. Also, see the MEGA FAQ <a href="https://help.mega.io/plans-storage/space-storage/transfer-quota">"What is transfer quota on MEGA?"</a>.

<h3> Are 07th-mod and Umineko Project related? </h3>

<p> No, they are separate modding groups. While we have communicated in the past, generally we are completely separate modding groups working on completely different types of mods for Umineko. </p>

<hr>

<h2> Historical Context</h2>

<p>07th-mod used to host a mirror of the Umineko Project. However, around 13/07/2024 we shutdown our main download server, and no longer host the Umineko Project downloads.</p>
