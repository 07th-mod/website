If you are good with computers, you should be able to help them.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Fix script typos, provide translations or add missing voices</p> <ul> <li>Fixing typos isn't that hard at all. All you need is a good editor (I like this one. This one is also very popular. And this one should be really good overall). The learning curve shouldn't be that long, and you'll thank me later for learning it. But if you want to fix just an type (this was deliberate), the web interface should be enough.</li> <li>Sometimes we want to add new scenes to the patch that are only available in Japanese. Do you know Japanese? If yes, awesome! We try our best to translate but if you ask me, I doubt we can actually pass as translators. If you are good at it, we really need your help!</li> <li>Missing voices is actually a big issue in the game. Sometimes we just can't find the right voice because of censorship or script changes. But if you find something that is a perfect fit (or maybe even really close), add that to the game!</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Add new features to the game</p> <ul> <li>We're always trying to make the patches closer and closer to their consoles counterparts. If you have a pretty good knowledge of the engines and programming, maybe you can help us get even closer to it. Hop in the issues section and open something with the enhancement label. We will love it the most when you already have something to show, but if you are a computer monster you can even make a pull request directly. Just don't forget to properly document it so we know what you did there.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Squish all the bugs</p> <ul> <li>Sometimes we just forget to put the brackets in the right place. If you find something like that when playing, how about trying to fix it? Check the editors a few lines above. Sometimes when the issue is too messy or you just don't know exactly how to fix it, just report it. Reporting is good and encouraged.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Improve the graphics</p> <ul> <li>It's not a voice and graphics patch without the graphics.

Since the mod uses it's own script, we are unaffected by this.</li> <li>MangaGamer forgot to update the game for some store + chapter combinations (such as GOG's Tsumihoroboshi Ch.6).

The redacted text is displayed differently, too.</li> <li>When everyone is joking about Keiichi and Mion's baby, on PS3 Rena chimes in saying that sounds weird.</li> <li>Keiichi gets a cider for himself and a grape juice for Rika, but on PS3 Rika asks to have the cider instead.</li> <li>Shion tells Kasai to eat his parfait, because he might die before he has another opportunity. This was cut on PS3.</li> <li>After the meeting with Rena, Keiichi hears Hanyuu apologizing on PS2, but on PS3 he has a vision of Onikakushi</li> <li>Text about the medication Rena was taking is slightly tweaked on PS3 to mesh with the console arcs</li> <li>On PS2 Rena has a short flashback to the dream she had near the end of Tsukiotoshi</li> <li>The Keiichi/Mion card game duel has different dialog. On PS2 he draws the joker, but on PS3 he draws the ace of spades.

On PS2 there's an extra scene from Matsuribayashi where a case he's working has ties to the Irie Clinic.

Each additional line takes memory or sequencing time, so trimming down the process usage is important.</p> <p>A lot of it relies on learning what each part does, by reading documentation, but also by actually seeing the effects directly, so that you become able to associate the methods and the results, to a point where reading the script is enough to visualize it playing out.</p> <p>Experiencing the effects is an important part to then foresee what the line you're removing or adding will change in the outcome. Especially because there might be some engine-specific changes that might need an adjustment in the scripts from one chapter to the other.</p> <p>I recommend reading through the script while playing the corresponding scene on the game at the same time, and maybe even try to guess how it should pay out then see how it actually takes place to understand the little things you had missed.</p> <p>Here is a scene from Onikakushi to better understand:</p> <pre><code>    if (GetGlobalFlag(GADVMode)) { OutputLineAll(\"\", NULL, Line_ContinueAfterTyping); }\n\n    OutputLine(NULL, \"\u3000\u4eca\u65e5\u306f\u30ec\u30ca\u3068\u9b45\u97f3\u306b\u96db\u898b\u6ca2\u3092\u3044\u308d\u3044\u308d\u3068\u6848\u5185\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3046\u65e5\u3060\u3002\",\n           NULL, \"Today was the day Rena and Mion were going to show me around Hinamizawa.\", Line_Normal);\n\n    ClearMessage();\n</code></pre> <p>This here is going to be the most common lines you'll see in the script, I call that a 'text bulk' because it always come as one part.</p> <p>The first line is the 'header' and will fill the nametag in ADV mode, here it's empty because it's not a spoken line and thus requires an empty name. The last parameter means that it will instantly continue to the next method after being written.</p> <p>Next is the actual line of text that will be written in the textbox(with the 2 languages), followed at the end by the parameter that determines what happens while writing it. Here it will wait for an input after it has finished writing, then will erase all text from the textbox.</p> <p>And finally, the last small method line is for the backlog, it will clear everything that's been written since the last cleaning(and the current written text if any), and add it to the log so that you are able to read back if you went too fast or else.</p> <p>This is the most basic version of 'text bulks' but you'll get to see many variations.</p> <pre><code>    DisableWindow();\n\n    PlayBGM( 1, \"msys01\", 128, 0 );\n\n    ModDrawCharacter(1, 3, \"sprite/normal/me2_def_a1_\", \"0\", -160, 0, 0, FALSE, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, FALSE );\n\n    ModDrawCharacter(3, 2, \"sprite/normal/re2a_def_a1_\", \"0\", 160, 0, 0, FALSE, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 20, 0, FALSE );\n\n    DrawSceneWithMask(\"background/ie1\", \"left\", 0, 0, 1300 );\n</code></pre> <p>Now, the script is going to do a transition scene.

It is important to understand that to make a scene, you have a good number of factors to take into consideration, and how each of the components are handled.</p> <p>The timing is also important, as you won't be able to make everything jump out; you need a proper entrance to it, but also a proper exit. Let's say for example, I want to have a music start playing and replace the current one, I'd have to make it fade out while playing the other on another channel, to have an incremental change as the old music fades out and the new starts, without a brutal cut.</p> <p>And unless it is for a specific usage, this applies to everything else.

We'll be considering that nothing happens beforehand but we'll still clean the text and musics in case, and then we'll start with slowly drawing a white scene while a bgm plays during the transition to 'introduce' the actual scene in case of remaining sprites or scenes, once that's done, we can draw the real scene and finish up by playing another bgm in addition to the first to make the sound ambience as the text starts.</p> <pre><code>    FadeOutBGM( 0, 0, FALSE );\n    FadeOutBGM( 1, 0, FALSE );\n    FadeOutBGM( 2, 0, FALSE );\n    ClearMessage();\n\n    PlayBGM( 2, \"lsys22\", 128, 0 );\n    DrawScene(\"white\", 3000 );\n    DrawSceneWithMask(\"background/ma_j3_01\", \"m1\", 0, 0, 3000 );\n    PlayBGM( 1, \"msys06\", 128, 0 );\n\n    if (GetGlobalFlag(GADVMode)) { OutputLineAll(\"\", NULL, Line_ContinueAfterTyping); }\n    OutputLine(NULL, \"\u3000\u5026\u6020\u611f\u3068\u982d\u75db\u3002\",\n           NULL, \"Weariness and a headache.\", GetGlobalFlag(GLinemodeSp));\n    if (GetGlobalFlag(GADVMode)) { ClearMessage(); } else { OutputLineAll(NULL, \"\\n\", Line_ContinueAfterTyping); }\n</code></pre> <p>The high time to draw the scenes is important to give the feeling of waking up while hearing bird chirps, and you'll notice that it's these small things that are important to give a feeling of immersion as you go.</p> <p>There is many more things you can do in that regard, like shaking the screen while playing a loud sound to simulate a hit or as simple as drawing a facial expression to show the change in tone of a character.</p> <p>By using the various tools at disposition and a little touch of creativity, you can make an impressive variety of effects to create quite immersive scenes.</p>"},{"location":"developer/scripting/on-scripting/#what-to-watch-out-for","title":"What To Watch Out For","text":"<p>But there are still points to keep in mind to avoid falling into traps and have unexpected results. In the many examples I could give, there is to never forget when you start a bgm, to fade it out. Despite the safeguards, it's still better to not let a track when it's supposed to be over.</p> <p>Another point is the priority, where some methods can be used simultaneously, but others can't, and some only with specific ones. Most of the draw with filter hog priority and forbid to have higher priority events happening at the same time(you can't draw with filter and a new scene, for example, or several filter draws). Which is why it's important to keep in mind what is prioritized over what when sequencing.</p> <p>Do not forget to disable the text box when doing effects, to focus the attention. Don't use the same layer priority for different characters or they'll trample over the sprites. Some methods can pass priority, others hog it. Try to avoid having any timing at 0 because it creates too harsh a cut, prefer using 100 or 50 for very fast changes, or the more global 300.</p> <p>Also, different chapters have different engines(the biggest gap being question arcs/answer arcs) and there can be several changes in how they're handled. In answer arcs, drawing a scene will now automatically disable the textbox, so adding it is not needed for it.</p> <p>The way priority is handled is also slightly different in that several related methods can trample over and create annoying issues if they're not separated by a 'high priority' method. For example having a fadeout and a play bgm methods in the same 'priority line'(not cut by a hogging priority method) will prevent the play bgm to act, no matter how much methods you add in between(creating the well known music bug).</p> <p>It also acts weirdly with sprite drawing, where several drawing can become ported over to the next scene drawing or after a new outputline, even if you try to keep priority(I've had to try many workarounds as it's very annoying, and one of the most efficient if possible is to redraw the scene with the new expression, and/or change the layer of the new sprite).</p> <p>In the end it'll rely mostly on the feel, the flow and testing it out, but hopefully all this'll help making it easier to start out.</p>"},{"location":"developer/scripting/on-scripting/#commonly-used-tools","title":"Commonly Used Tools","text":"<p>Finally I'll describe some of the most commonly used tools I use to make editing easier:</p> <pre><code>    DrawBustshot(5, \"black\", 0, 0, 0, FALSE, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 25, 500, TRUE );\n</code></pre> <p>This is a convenient tool if you need to draw effects, or to not have to change a scene. It's the main way to make multi layered effects. Though note that it's not used to draw character sprites. It has weak priority and can be added in a priority line. Note that there is a DrawSprite variant that is more prioritizing, and is able to change some things like the orientation, to be used in more technical scenes.

Open both the target font and the one you just downloaded using FontForge.  Navigate to <code>Element \u2192 Font Info</code> with both fonts, go to the <code>General</code> tab, and adjust the Em Size of one of the fonts to match the other (if you don't do this, one of the fonts will be way too small or big).  Then, select <code>Element \u2192 Merge Fonts...</code> in the window for the target font to copy all missing glyphs from the Japanese font over. In addition, some fonts (like our current English font) use really thin lines for the \u2606 character, which Higurashi uses a lot.  Thin lines don't do very well with the font rendering system the game uses, which makes the character look really bad.  Navigate to the entry for \u2606, which you can do easily by selecting <code>View \u2192 Goto</code> and typing <code>uni2606</code>, and check if your font uses really thin lines.

The current fonts use 26pt, but you can choose whatever you like.  Bigger font sizes use more space but look nicer.  Change Font Padding to 6 pt.  If your characters almost fit in the atlas but not quite, you can change the packing method from Fast to Optimal to pack a few more characters in.</p> <p>For the Atlas Resolution, larger numbers take up more space but allow more or larger characters.

Leave Font Style at Normal/2 and change Font Render Mode to Distance Field 32 (Note: This is the slowest and highest quality.  If you're still trying to figure out what font/atlas sizes you need, I recommend first choosing Hinted Smooth, which will slightly underestimate the size of the characters but be super fast, then use Distance Field 16 which will get all the character sizes right while still being faster than Distance Field 32, before finally choosing Distance Field 32 for the one you save).</p> <p>Next, click Generate Font Atlas.  This will take a while for large atlases.  When it's done, it will say in the box if it was unable to fit any characters.  If the resulting atlas is completely full, this is probably because those characters didn't fit, in which case you should adjust your atlas size or font size.  Otherwise, this is because TextMeshPro failed to find those characters in your font.  If it's just some newline characters or spaces this is fine, just look through them to make sure it didn't miss any characters that you think you need.</p> <p>Once you've saved the font, use the Unity inspector to change its Line Height to be equal to its Point Size.
